      <h1>Parent Interview</h1>

      <p>
        I interviewed one of my parents to gain insight into my cognitive, social,
        and moral development, as well as to better understand their parenting
        style and how it differed from the way they were raised.

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: What was I like as a young child?</h3>
        <p>
          A: You were very curious and energetic. You liked to explore everything
          around you and were not afraid to touch, test, or take things apart.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: Did my curiosity ever get me into trouble?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Yes, quite often. You sometimes broke things because you wanted to
          figure out how they worked, not because you were trying to be naughty.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: How did I usually respond when I got in trouble?</h3>
        <p>
          A: At first you were focused on the consequences, but once we explained
          why something was wrong, you understood quickly and adjusted your
          behavior.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: How would you describe my thinking and problem-solving skills?</h3>
        <p>
          A: You preferred learning by doing. You learned best through trial and
          error and liked figuring things out on your own rather than being given
          answers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: How did my social development change as I grew older?</h3>
        <p>
          A: You were independent and sometimes stubborn when you were younger,
          but over time you became more cooperative and comfortable working with
          others, especially on shared goals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: How did my sense of right and wrong develop?</h3>
        <p>
          A: When you were younger, you cared mostly about rules and punishment.
          As you got older, you started thinking more about fairness and how your
          actions affected other people.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: When did you notice me becoming more responsible?</h3>
        <p>
          A: We noticed it when you began taking leadership roles and helping
          others. You started thinking ahead and taking responsibility for
          outcomes, not just tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: How would you describe your parenting style?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Supportive but structured. We set clear expectations while allowing
          you room to explore, make mistakes, and learn from them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>
          Q: How was your parenting style different from how your parents raised
          you?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A: My parents were stricter and focused more on obedience. With you, we
          focused more on communication and explaining the reasons behind rules.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="event">
        <h3>Q: What values did you most want to teach me?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Curiosity, responsibility, integrity, and perseverance — and how to
          use your abilities in positive and meaningful ways.
